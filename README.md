### This C++ program performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication on numbers even up to 32 digits in length.
### Here are the files I made and their functionalities:

## List.h:
    Initializes all functions used in List.c. The parameters and return values in List.h and List.c should match to avoid errors.

## List.cpp:
    Implements the functions in List.h and creates and uses a Node constructor, a List Constructor, a copy of the List Constructor, and finally a Destructor. This .cpp file uses the List contructor to create a List object and Node constructor to create Node objects that are referenced by the List objects.

## ListTest.cpp:
    Tests the functions in List.cpp with sample Lists and uses those functions to modify the Lists. If the functions work, print a message saying that the functions work.

## BigInteger.h:
    Initializes all functions used in BigInteger.c. The parameters and return values in BigInteger.h and BigInteger.c should match to avoid errors.

## BIgInteger.cpp:
    Implements the functions in BigInteer.h and creates and uses a BigInteger Constructor, a copy of the BigInteger Constructor, and finally a Destructor. This .cpp file uses the Bignteger contructor to create a BigInteger object.
## BigINtegerTest.cpp:
    Tests the functions in BigInteger.cpp with sample BigIntegers and uses those functions to modify the BIgIntegers. If the functions work, print a message saying that the functions work.

## Arithmetic.cpp: 
    This is where I write the main program. This is where I print all the outputs of my functions I wrote in BigInteger.cpp.

## Makefile:
    This file is used to run the files. I can use commands like make and make clean to run whatever files I want.

## README.md:
    This file has the descriptions of what the List.h, List.cpp, ListTest.cpp, BigInteger.h, BigInteger.cpp, BigIntegerTest.cpp, Arithmetic.cpp, Makefile, and README.md files do.
